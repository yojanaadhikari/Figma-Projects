Application 2: Nurture

The second app I worked on, Nurture, is a plant care assistant designed to help users take care of their plants with ease. Users can customize Nurture to receive reminders for essential tasks like watering and fertilizing, making it easy to stay on top of plant care routines.

Nurture also includes tools to identify different plant types and diagnose common plant issues. If a plant shows signs of disease, the app provides suggestions for treatment, helping users keep their plants healthy. This project showcases my skills in designing practical, user-focused features for everyday plant care.

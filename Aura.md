Website 4: Aura

My next project, Aura, is a fashion blog website that covers trending topics across categories like Fashion, Beauty, Travel, Life, and Runway. Each category features blogs on the latest trends, helping users stay updated with whatâ€™s popular in each area.

Aura also offers a subscription option where users can sign up with their Google accounts to receive the latest updates directly. This project demonstrates my ability to design a stylish, easy-to-navigate blog platform that keeps users engaged with fresh, relevant content.

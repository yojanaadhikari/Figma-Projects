Application 3: INCURE

The third app I developed, **INCURE**, is an appointment scheduling tool for hospitals, helping patients book appointments with ease. Users can browse doctor profiles, check their experience, and schedule visits, making healthcare access more convenient.
Incure also includes a symptom-based diagnosis feature. Patients can input symptoms theyâ€™re experiencing, and the app recommends a suitable doctor based on the likely condition. This project highlights my ability to design healthcare solutions that simplify the patient experience and connect them to the right medical care.

Website 3: STEPPE

My next project, STEPPE, is an e-commerce website for a shoe shop, offering a wide range of footwear for men, women, and kids. The site is organized with clear categories and subcategories, allowing users to easily browse and find the shoes theyâ€™re looking for.

STEPPE presents each shoe with detailed images, descriptions, and pricing, creating a smooth shopping experience. This project showcases my skills in designing an intuitive, user-friendly layout tailored to online retail.

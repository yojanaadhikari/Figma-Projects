Application 1: BookGo

My first project, BookGo, is a hotel booking app that helps users find hotels around the world within different price ranges. It features an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to search and filter hotels by price and amenities for a smooth booking experience.

BookGo supports various payment options, including PayPal, Google Pay, and credit cards, to accommodate user preferences. It also offers a simple cancellation feature, allowing users to modify their bookings easily. This project highlights my focus on user-friendly design and improving the travel experience.

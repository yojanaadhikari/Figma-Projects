Website 2: Eatsy


I developed Eatsy, a website for a Korean and Japanese restaurant that showcases all available dishes. The site features a well-organized menu with sections for Korean and Japanese cuisines, making it easy for users to explore their options.

Eatsy also includes a gallery that displays each dish with its price and ingredients, helping users choose meals with confidence. This project highlights my ability to design a visually appealing and informative dining experience, enhancing user engagement with the restaurantâ€™s offerings.

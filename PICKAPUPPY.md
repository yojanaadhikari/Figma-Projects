Website-1: PICKAPUPPY

I worked on PICKAPUPPY, a pet adoption website that helps users find cats and dogs available for adoption. Users can browse pet profiles and apply for adoption by filling out a simple form, making it easy to connect animals with loving homes.

Additionally, PICKAPUPPY allows users to support the organization through donations or by applying for various volunteer opportunities. This project reflects my focus on creating a user-friendly platform that not only facilitates pet adoption but also supports community involvement in animal care.
